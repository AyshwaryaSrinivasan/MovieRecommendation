Streaming services such as Netflix, Prime, Hulu are garnering more and more audience each day. With more streaming services than one can keep a count of coming up, families must decide as to which service to subscribe to. Increasingly, the quality of recommendations a service has become pivotal to this decision making. The objective of this project is to recommend movies for a subscriber to watch.

While there are several factors that one could consider while creating a recommendation engine, in this project we are focusing on a few aspects of the user and the movie to provide recommendation. We would be focusing on the movie genre, the tags associated with it, the director and cast of the movie. We will also be focusing on recommending movies to a user based on how close his taste matches with another user. The goal of this project is to provide holistic experience to a user by providing recommendations based on various criteria such as popularity, user-user collaborative filtering and content filtering.

We first perform Data Cleaning and then perform Exploratory Data Analysis. Our Analysis is split into 3 parts. 

* Popularity based recommendation
* Content based recommendation
* Collaborative recommendation
